This is the personal implementation of the 2018 spring OS Labs at Nanjing University instructed by Dr. Jiang Yanyan. The project is opensourced under GPL v3.

* Warning to my dear classmates *
You will be at your own risk if you use any of the code in this repository. 

= pstree.c =

This project implemented a miniature of the classic UNIX command pstree by reading kernel information from the /proc directory(thus makes it only compatible with Linux), which lists all the processes running in the form of a tree. The program implemented 3 options wwhich are
  -p, --show-pids:      which prints out the PID of each process.
  -n, --numeric-sort:   which sorts all the processes by their PIDs.
  -k, --kernel-threads: which prints out the kernel threads along side with normal output.
Also a -V or --version option is available to provide version informaion of the program.

= perf.c =

Performance evaluator which lists all the system calls during the process and the time they cost. (It is in fact no more than a *beautiful* shell of "strace -T")

= crepl.c=

C read-evaluate-print-loop. It takes the input of a valid C code (but with some limitations) to provide an interactive C code shell. Limitations includes
1. Only int functions are accepted and registered.
2. All other code will be regarded as an expression.
3. A function or an expression must take and only take a single line.
4. All other input's results will be undefined.
